The story progresses the most whenever you die out there, making failure not sting quite as much, at the same time after you have once won you can stack modifiers as long as you want to make the game infinitely harder, for those hardcore roguelike players.

At the time of this review, I am just 3 hours in, but every single moment so far has been enjoyable.The level design is amazing. It packs a challenge with decent mechanics and a good mix of randomness.It is a classic roguelite arpg. Every time we start from the beginning, we get to spend a variety of resources to develop our character in different ways, and it helps a little every time we do it. Expect to die a lot early on, but it makes each breakthrough a glorious triumph of some kind.The game has a bit of background story in the form of Greek mythology. As a classicist, the game codex and narrative (however limited the latter is) put a smile on my face. Anyone who loves mythology, especially Greek mythology, should feel the same.Anyway, Hades is a game that I would recommend to at least give it a try. It is already very solid, and it would have been the absolute choice of GOTY if the story was more intriguing and developed.Rating: 8/10P.S.: I nominated this game for the \"Most Innovative Gameplay\" award instead of GOTY.',\n",

There are 6 base weapons in the game, and I believe this is the first game I\\'ve played where they all feel balanced and great to use! Also don\\'t get me started when it comes to (light game system spoiler  weapon aspects, each weapon has 4 aspects, which act like subclasses or specs for a weapon, changing how they play, each weapon\\'s first of four aspects is Zagreus\\' aspect, all of which are all pretty simple, increasing your crit chance, attack speed, move speed, pretty passive buffs that are easy to digest, while on the other hand some can totally change the way a weapon is used to the point where it feels like a totally different weapon,  very impressed!*Bouncing off of my last point, the game offers different boons or upgrades from the various Olympian Gods, all with their own flavour, while being easy to digest, no run can feel the same (kinda, unless you use some keepsakes to guarantee a god spawn, which has it\\'s own cost)Cons:*Visual clarity at times. At times the screen can be quite cluttered and certain enemies/effects can be buried by the arena and other visual effects, though this very rarely causes an end of a run for myself, so take from it what you will.*Lack of enemy variety/arenas - there are only  4  zones in the game,  Tartarus, Asphodel, Elysium & Styx . With 73 hours in the game, it takes me about 20-25 minutes per run taking my time, not trying to speedrun it at all, so seeing the same zones and enemies over and over again can be quite tiresome, though the devs do try to rectify this issue through the (mild game system spoiler, VERY light/vague story spoiler)  endgame Heat System, adding different gameplay modifiers, such as adding new mechanics to bosses and the like  which the devs have done well to tie this in with the story.*RNG is RNG, sometimes you can get several powerful \"duo\" boons from the gods without aiming for them, other times you can take the keepsakes that boost your chances, and go a whole run without seeing one, take this as a pro or con, as if it were guaranteed, it\\'d be less satisfying when you do obtain it.',\n",

I don't normally play isometric hack and slash, but this one really pulled me in, hard - I don't plan on stop playing this game, it really is addicting and I can find myself putting in hundreds more hours to master the weapons, unlock all there is to the game, and challenge myself on the hardest customized challenges at the top-tier difficulties.\",\n",

Taking the standard rogue-lite loop (Gain Knowledge/Skill, Die, Respawn, and Upgrade) and weaving it into the the Greek mythos is a master class of cognitive resonance.But what is Hades? It is a isometric hack-and-slasher (Fans of Bastion will feel right at home!). You'll go through chambers collecting materials off defeated foes or broken scenery and eventually die to be respawned back in the Court of Hades. There, you can encounter some of the cast of characters that makes up Hades and choose to engage in dialogue, increase relationship bonds or ignore them all together.

       " \"Hades: Defying Dad; Greek-style!  Intro:Ahh, Greek myth.  One of the cornerstones for our cultural obsession with terrible people doing terrible things to each other for stupid reasons.  Thankfully, Supergiant Games is here to remedy this by telling a story about moderately selfish people defying their Dad due to poor communication skills and a teenager's rebellion phase.  I should disclose that I have not finished Hades, in any other situation I would have played until completion. But with the 10th drawing close, I want to make sure that I am free to move onto Cyberpunk 2077 in time.  That being said, however, I bloody love Hades; it is one of the best I have played this year. Gameplay:Hades is a Roguelikes, which means that you can expect several common attributes: randomized level layout, permadeath, and gradual increment of power against a rising difficulty curve.  Nevertheless, Hades mixes up this well-worn, reliable formula with some tricks of its own to spice things up.Boons of the godsIn each run, you are granted a random assortment of buffs from the various Olympian gods.  While the randomness can backfire on you, some boons are just not compatible with the weapon you chose at the start it can also enhance your run.  Hades forces you to experiment with boons that you might not have thought compatible.  When boons are combining, you feel gradually powerful, as lighting strikes combatants while slowing and rupturing Zagreus’s foes.  Boons also add another level of strategy to proceedings.  Weapons that have knockback benefit from Poseidon while fast-paced weapons benefit from Zeus buffs. Levels and the problem with RoguelikesRoguelikes tend to have a problem intricate to the genre itself.  Namely, that randomized levels tend to become unremarkable and rather repetitive.  An algorithm might,( in theory) create an indifferent number of levels,   but in reality, tends to create some very similar levels.  There are only so many entrances and exits at any given level.  As a result, the player will just go through the same levels from slightly different angles.  The levels rather blur together, unmemorable parts of an otherwise distinct stage.   Please note that this is more of a shortcoming of the genre as opposed to Hades the game.  It makes the means of exploring each stage disappointingly weak and mechanical as opposed to a real place.  Although explained within the lore (the underworld changes to order to prevent people from leaving), so I suppose that makes it less of a problem?https://www.imaginativeramblings.com/post/hades-defying-dad-greek-style Full review here.\",\n",

They all have amazing art and atmosphere, a great story, great characters..great everything. Every game tries to do something unique and it's always fun, even if it's a bit unconventional sometimes. And the music, which is always amazing, is rightfully praised to high heaven by a ton of people across the internet.So last year when I heard that these guys - these absolute legends - were gonna make a new game based in Hades and it's a heccin' rogue like (!!!) I knew this was gonna be one of my favourite games before I even started it. I played it in early access on Epic games for a month, loved every second of it, and then resolved to not touch it again till full release. Because I anted to go in blind when it was fully ready.At time of writing, I played this game on Steam for less than an hour. I hardly remember anything from that month I played, so I have no idea what's in store. All I know is that I need to go get every achievement in this game to complete my quest to %100 every Supergiant game. And I'm gonna have a great time doing it.I have total confidence that this is gonna be amazing. So much so that, even though I barely played it, I'm gonna drop a review for it right now anyways because I need to review a game from 2020 for the Steam Autumn Sale badge and I waaant it.\",\n",

I don't care about storyline, so I felt like I was locked into spending 10-20% of my time in game skipping dialogue and talking to npcs to skip more dialogue.It's a solid roguelike with enough control of the RNG that there isn't a lot of difficulty unless you make very intentional choices about the harder things you want to fight. A lot of the difficulty is mitigated by grinding materials to upgrade stuff, and having a good idea for combinations of traits that will allow for a straightforward clear. I think I took 16 runs of varying effort before I got a full clear, and since then it's only gotten easier and streaks have gotten more reliable, even after adding a bunch of modifiers.Yeah, so 4/5 game in the sense that I don't really believe in perfect games. Challenging but not too challenging, multitude of story plot lines to follow throughout your runs, and very stylish design feels really good to play. I don't think Hades is for the person who wants to play a game and not be involved in the story, there's too many npcs with dialogue and backstories they've lovingly crafted.

It requires both strategy skills and quick hand eye coordination, and trying not to give away spoilers here, forces you to fail repeatedly at times before you can achieve the next goal.It was frustrating at first until you realize repeatedly dying is the game...I almost quit playing it before I was even an hour into it...Once I got comfortable with the game mechanics it became really enjoyable and has a lot of achievements that keep you coming back again and again... I'm almost 120 hours into my first play through and I've only gotten 24/49 achievements.  The difficulty of this game scales up really quickly and the game is designed to make you fail time and time again trying to grow stronger bit by bit to get the next goal.  WARNING!!!  THIS GAME IS NOT EASY!!! I would not recommend this for casual gamers or people who don't handle repeated defeat well... On the other hand, because the game is so difficult, I really feel a sense of accomplishment for completing the next achievement, and this is what keeps me coming back for more time and time again.  I enjoy the fact that the game is not a cake walk, and if you are looking for a game to challenge your twitchy and strategic gaming skills, then you might want to check this one out...The writing for this game is terrific and the majority of the character dialogue is well done voice acting.  The music for this game is great as well.  It's got a kind of funky grungy rock sound track that is anchored by some killer bass riffs.  The music (almost) sounds organic especially the bass solos between conflicts.  The artwork for this game is very nice as well. The only reason I mention the writing first is that I value that in a game more than being pretty.The bad thing I will say is the difficulty of the game (I know it's what I said was good about it, but it's more about the audience)...  I've gotten in a rut more than once I thought I wouldn't be able to get out of.  If you don't enjoy stiff adversity to overcome in a game then this isn't for you.In conclusion I personally love this game...

       " \"Hades is easily Supergiant's best game both in terms of gameplay and presentation. The engrossing, slowly unfolding story is what kept me diving back into Hades rogue-like dungeon to get my ass pummeled by underworld minions. Even when you fail to complete the dungeon, you still get more story beats and get to deepen your relationship with Hades' pantheon.After over 100 runs (and 60+ escapes), the game still feels fun. I can't recommend it more, honestly.\",\n",

       " 'The single greatest amalgamation of story and gameplay I\\'ve ever seen--the two are never removed from each other, and the dialogue always contributes something to the feeling. A lot of current single-player games either leave the player a mute protagonist, or have you controlling an unlikable and flimsy character. Hades does an incredible job of not only making you root for Zagreus, but really connecting with him on an emotional level through his determination and witty banter. To say nothing of the supporting cast, who are equally funny and sometimes even tearjerking! The artwork, music, and voice acting marry together to bring Hades to (after)life.My favorite part of this game, as someone who sucks at them, is not only that you aren\\'t ever shamed for dying or losing, and in fact it is a major point of gameplay. Hades also features a \"God Mode\" which gradually decreases the amount of damage you take with each death--meaning for players who have a hard time with the standard difficulty (such as those with disabilities), it\\'s not impossible to enjoy the story. The game does not chide you for this, either, which is such a relief to those who might not be able to play otherwise! From the bottom of my heart, thank you for this!',\n",

It's also what I put in for the Game of the Year Award, because to me that's exactly what it is.  Finally a game I feel excited to boot up time after time that's not riddled with micro transactions, loot crates, and other all too common problems that have seriously ruined modern gaming for me.Hades has a vibrant cast of characters, is absolutely gorgeous, and has probably the best rogue like gameplay that I've experienced.  If you are super good at games and blow through a playthrough too fast you can get a little bit of text that's out of context, like people saying something is impossible after you've already done it.  But aside from that I can't think of a single thing I'd change.

       " 'I LOVE SUPERGIANT GAMES I would just like it to be known that I really love/respect the people at Supergiant Games, not only are they capable of bringing out a fun game but also immersive stories. Can I also say that these lovable people came out with this game during such difficult times and PUT THE GAME ON DISCOUNT ON INITIAL RELEASE! LIKE WHAT!? I would say that this won\\'t affect my review for the game, but these people are way too damn awesome for it not to affect my outlook.   HOWEVER THIS GAME IS FREAKING AMAZING, SO IT DOESN\\'T EVEN MATTER HOW MUCH IT AFFECTS MY REVIEW  . Story/Stories (10/10) This game has a lovable main protagonist (Zagreus) and unforgettable side characters, making the main story of the game extremely enjoyable!  HOWEVER  , the stories don\\'t stop there! This game implements a social system that will allow you to intertwine your story with those around you, allowing a constant evolution of not only the plethora of characters portrayed within the game but the inclusion of more game mechanics and minor environmental changes. Gameplay (10/10) The combat is extremely enjoyable, being easy to pick up and enjoyable to (eventually) master, the addition of multiple weapons and variations adds to the replayability of the game. Each weapon is completely diverse, weapon variations less so - but enough to both diversify and satisfy each variation as its own.Also, there is fishing in this game, which is a big plus for me! Music/Sound (10/10) I find, that a lot of the time, music can either do nothing for a game or enhance it to a whole new level; this game portrays the latter. The music of the game feeds into the atmosphere, rather than becoming too intrusive or non-existent.  Most memorable would be Orpheus and Eurydice\\'s duet of \"Good Riddance\". Their duet was able to portray a story within the confines of the lyrics rather than explicit writing - this form of writing is very hard to come by, even with all these \"triple-A games\" coming out  Yes, I bought the soundtrack, no you don\\'t have to - but you will!(Side note) Darren Korb not only wrote the Music for Hades (also writing the music for Bastion, Transistor, and Pyre [other awesome Supergiant Games games]), he had also done the sound design for the game - big props to this lad! Voice Acting (10/10) Remember Darren Korb, the guy that did both the music and sound design - yeah - HE VOICED ZAGREUS AND SKELLY  he also sang Orpheus\\' version of \"Good Riddance\".  I would recommend this game over Darren Korb alone if it weren\\'t for the fact that this game is just flat-out, outright amazing! Logan Cunningham (the voice of the transistor from Transistor) was the voice of Hades, Poseidon, Achilles, Asterius, Charon, and THE NARRATOR! There are so many more memorable voice actors, and I could go on about how these voice actors are just too good but you get the point. I don\\'t listen to ASMR, BUT THIS IS MY ASMR! Payoff/Reward (9/10) Branching off of my high praise for the stories, this is one of the main reasons I find myself excited post-mortem rather than frustrated. Having the ability to advance the stories of some of my favorite side-characters kept me constantly excited to start a new run. Additionally, with every run, resources can be used to buy upgrades that can either enhance/completely change a run or some aesthetics of the game. After completing a multitude of runs (and I mean, over 50) and completing all stories (main and side), the game will eventually lose much of its beauty due to the repetitive nature of the rogue-light genre becoming more prevalent with the more times you play after finishing the ENTIRE game. However, this is a normal occurrence with all rogue-light/like games- and games in general; thus, I don\\'t think it fair to judge the game because of this inevitable outcome. My only legitimate complaint that I can bring against the game currently is the fact that the story is not longer, IT\\'S AMAZING DON\\'T GET ME WRONG, but I wish there was more. Having some sort of Steam Workshop integration or mod capabilities would make this game truly endless. However, I am a greedy baby, and this game is cocaine. User Interface 10/10 It has everything you need in a clean and orderly fashion. It\\'s neither intrusive nor aggressively minimalistic, it sits in a very comfortable middle-ground.  the ability to purchase different variations of the UI is a welcomed addition, but I don\\'t think it\\'s worth going out of the way for.  My only issue, my very small issue, with the game\\'s UI would be the way certain resources are absent when you don\\'t have any. Meaning, when you have zero of a certain resource, the icon simply disappears rather than having the number zero next to the missing item. Although I understand the creative reasoning behind it (help conserve the neat nature of the UI) for some reason my brain can\\'t handle playing \"Spot the Difference\" in a somewhat high-paced game like Hades. tl;dr 9.99999999/10 The game is great, the people behind the game are amazing. Everything is fine, and this game is awesome. Definitely worth the buy due to the story, music, and gameplay making an overall unforgettable experience. Although the game does suffer from the rogue-light/like curse of losing enjoyment after investing several hours of playtime, you will invest more time into this game than any other rogue light/like due to the way it was created. You can tell this was a project made with love- almost feeling the blood, sweat, and tears radiating off of the game.',\n",

       " 'Full disclosure: I\\'ve wanted to love rogue-like games for the longest time. The idea of having to beat a game in one flawless go, with only the things you\\'ve picked up along the way in that one run - just sounds amazing to me. Always only being a few careless mistakes or unfocused moments from starting an entire run over sounds like one of the most thrilling gameplay experiences you could ever have. It seems like the embodiment of one of my favorite video game quotes of all time: making every shot count. But as much as I wanted to love them, there was something about the ones that I\\'d tried - whether it was the aesthetics, the gameplay style, or even just the premise of the game itself - that made it impossible for me to get into them. To be honest, I had completely written them off as a genre that really just wasn\\'t for me. And then along came Supergiant with their \"god-like, rogue-like dungeon crawler\" that \"combines the best aspects of Supergiant\\'s critically acclaimed titles\". Being a huge admirer and lover of every title Supergiant Games has given us so far, I took those words to heart, trusting that, in Supergiant\\'s hands, maybe, despite its genre, this could be another game with which I could fall in love. And I\\'m glad (almost) beyond words, that I was right.The words on the tin really are exactly what you\\'re getting with Supergiant\\'s latest game, Hades. It combines frenetic and immensely satisfying combat with incredibly deep world-building and story telling, a deliciously irreverent score that isn\\'t afraid to use unique time signatures and other subtle tricks to get you in that perfect Underworld-thrashing mood. It really is a perfect melding of gameplay, where everything you do, every single item and pickup and power-up and moment you spend with it feeds back into the cycle of dying again and again and again. And I did I mention the cast yet? No? Okay, literally every character is some form of hot. I don\\'t know how you did this, character designers and voice actors but... wow. No, I\\'m not joking - everyone is really hot.  Aphrodite I\\'m free for literal eternity plz call me thnx~   It\\'s these characters that (beyond being incredibly attractive) make Hades so special. It has gotten to the point for me where, even though I\\'m now trying different builds out to finally vanquish the Final Boss - and yes, that does mean starting over and dying and starting over and dying again and again and again - I really don\\'t mind! I\\'m relatively happy to come back to the game\\'s hub and catch up on all the hot gossip with my fave characters that I might have missed while I\\'m away. And that\\'s to say nothing of the story moments you could potentially get while you\\'re busy battling through Tartarus itself! It\\'s easily the game\\'s biggest strength, and what sets it apart from other rogue-likes I\\'ve tried.Quite simply, with Hades, you are always accomplishing something, whether it\\'s getting more Darkness (experience to make you permanently stronger), gems for the good House Contractor (for aesthetics and cosmetics in the House of Hades), nectar for your best mates (for relationship progress and gift-giving), keys (for unlocking new weapons, abilities, and buffs), and more! There are so many intertwined systems in Hades, and, much like the game itself, all of these items feed back into your runs in a beautifully complimentary loop. That\\'s to say nothing of the combat, where each weapon, power-up, and boon feel distinctly unique, and really match the feeling of the god or goddess who you got it from! Even after I \"beat\" the game, I can already see myself going back to it just to try out new builds, just to see if I can get to the surface that much faster. My only tiny of the tiniest complaints is that sometimes aim assist can really screw you over sometimes - but again, it\\'s the tiniest of complaints. Maybe turn it off or use a mouse and keyboard instead of the initially recommended controller if it\\'s giving you too much trouble.I can wholeheartedly recommend this gem of a game to anyone who, like me, has ever wanted to like rogue-like games - and even more so if you were a fan of Supergiant\\'s past games but just weren\\'t sure about the whole rogue-like thing. We are absolutely in the most capable of hands. Supergiant\\'s god-like rogue-like game really is as good as you\\'ve been hearing - a gem of a game that has finally made me want to try and die again and again and again - and for that, I can give it nothing but the highest of praise.Hades is my Game of the Year nomination for the 2020 Steam Awards.',\n",
       " 'This is the best rogue-like game ever PERIOD',\n",
       " 'Wow, just wow.  I play a lot of roguelikes and this one really nails it.  Even the runs where things go wrong are fun to the end and dying so you get to see what comes next in the hub world is the best part.',\n",
       " 'Game has a rather sharp atmosphere.',\n",
       " 'This is (so far) the best game from Supergiant – The gameplay, the controls, the characters, the sound track, the design: Everything is a master piece. The story is a little simple, with some good plot twists, but – In my opinion – What really make the game shine is actually all the side quests while you go through hell itself to help those you love, and those that you will still love.If there is any kind of drawback is the amount of grinding you have to do – Even though it wasn\\'t painful, at least for me, as I really love some roguelite games, but you have to grind even to complete some quests, that appear as random in a \"queue\" of interactions you will have with side characters. So, basically, it took me around 100h of game to get all interactions and complete every single side quest. But, also, if I died more often, some quests would be faster to complete.From a story perspective, the characters are really appealing and there is a lot of moments that my girlfriend and I literally laughed out loud, and we\\'re still waiting to see if Supergiant will make a new patch just for you to romance some new characters, as we fell deeply in love with Artemis and Dionysus. It\\'s the kind of game that you are rooting every second to see a sequel or any kind of spin-off.From a gameplay perspective, it\\'s a roguelite dream: You literally have thousands and THOUSANDS of combinations. I cleared almost 90 runs in the game and always felt that I did something different – Sometimes in the slightest, sometimes completely different.The game is really fair. If you\\'re struggling, there\\'s a \"God Mode\" that gives you 2% of Damage Reduction every time you die, and you can deactivate whenever you feel like. But if you\\'re the kind of gamer that compulsively needs to hit their own chest and scream to everyone that this game is not as hard as Dark Souls, you can tune up the game to make it hard as hell (no pun intended… Apart from the Dark Souls part).Anyway, it\\'s an incredible game, one of my favourites from all time now, and would definitely marry Artemis. 13/10, please Supergiant, make more games like this one.',\n",

I've been wanting something that I could replay multiple times and get a new experience, something mind-blowing. And here it is, I can't even begin to describe it. The art direction in this game alone was stunning and I don't even want to know how long did the team work on all those beautifully crafted dungeons but they are full of life and color, making it easy to see what is happening in the room and register attacks. The game play is also excellent, with satisfying combos and cool move sets for every weapon used, allowing for variety and trying out new stuff. Not to mention the hype music, with cool rock instrumentals that appear in most dungeons, but never becomes too obnoxious to the ears. However, the thing that really sells it for me though is the replayability of it, and the thrill of getting further into the map. This is what really keeps the game from becoming too stagnant or too safe, allowing for truly engrossing game play.

And less of one than you might think. Failure will still move many of the stories forward. So try again, no try is truly wasted.At some point you do have to beat it a few times, but you can get surprisingly far being bad as I discovered. The first victory is ever so sweet, and then as you win again and again you may still fail a few times. I discovered at that point as I tried to win using weapons I was just rubbish at that the game still progresses some characters stories without you winning. Though for the main story you do need to get some consistent wins. There's no way to say much about the story without spoiling it, but it's extremely good and has its surprising turns and twists with many heartfelt moments along the way.

       " \"Spoiler-free review. I wants the badge, yes.Hades is the latest game from Supergiant, a masterfully crafted hack and slash title with visual novel elements. You play as a young godling trying to escape the deepest pits of hell, with a little help from the gods of Greek mythology. Up close and personal or at a distance, choose how you want to tackle enemies with a somewhat limited array of weapons, but extensive in terms of their locked or hidden potential.In Hades, death does not feel like a punishment, not achieving what you set out to do is but one of many ways to experience what else the game has to offer. As you die, you can reflect back on yourself and permanently increase your survivability and/or effectiveness, with the option to counter-balance your ever-growing power with specific difficulty tweaks, and tailor the next run to match your current skill level.The procedurally-generated nature of Hades is limited and simple in its execution, and therefore does not contribute to the overall complexity of the game. Given enough runs, you will be left with a mental map imprinted in your mind, however, whilst the surrounding environment doesn't take new architectural shapes each time -- the general variation is enough to make sure those runs are not quite the same.Right as you start thinking there isn't much left to it, Hades lifts the curtain, and begins to make a habit of surprising you. This little and not so hidden gem is definitely worth your time and attention; its compelling plot, fully voiced dialogue (of which there is a lot), interesting cast of characters, visually appealing environments, solid gameplay mechanics, simple yet effective rng elements, beautiful soundtrack, and a countless number of little and unnecessary details will keep you entertained, distracted, and coming back for more despite the inevitability of an express trip back to the crimson pool.\",\n",

After around ~80 runs of the game I can also attest to the fact that the game play is addictive and the 'game play loop' is mostly satisfying. The variety of weapons and the bonuses you get for changing each weapon each run helps each play through to stay fresh. After so many hours in the game you do find sequences and paths that are better for each weapon, or just better in general. Some gods are just worse than others in terms of damage out put or survivability. However, with the number of gods that are in this game it is surprising how well so many of them work well together.I didn't know how I felt about the pact of punishment in the beginning either, but this feature turned out to be one of my more favorite additions to the game. Being able to adjust how the game got harder, and how I wanted to complete my heat 16 run felt better. Heat 32 runs you obviously don't get as many options, but in a way that's okay with how that is the 'end goal' of the difficult path.The soundtrack is also an amazing addition to an already beautiful and tight controlled game. Normally after ~20 hours in any game I'll turn off the music and switch to my own, but this game is one where I have kept it on for the full 84 hours (at the time of this review) that I've played.Great music, story, game play mechanics, game play controls, and feel of progression of any rougelite. I do feel like there is an end point for this rougelite though that others do not have. Once the 'story' is over in this game I feel like I would not touch it again. That may or may not be an issue with the cost of the game vs the time needed to complete that point though.\",\n",

I think Hades does that better than any roguelike/lite I have ever played. However, in the aspect of gameplay and being a rogue lite in general it simply has nothing on the binding of Isaac, Dead Cells etc. The combat is nowhere near as good and presice as the legends of the genre and even worse, the replayability is bad for a roguelite. Yeah I\\'ve played around 100 hours, but I\\'ve played other roguelites/likes much more and I keep coming back, whereas here, I loved my first 10-15 hours, then I kept playing to see the plot. Now I just don\\'t feel the \"hooked\" feeling games like BoI and Dead Cells give me. The run variation is way too small and it starts becoming boring fast. In addition to that the controls are mediocre and when you start playing higher difficulties/biomes it becomes a \"mash the dodge button like a madman, attack, clear room, repeat\" experience.I still recommend this game, I think it is a great game in its own right, just a bad roguelike. I don\\'t regret in the slightest the time I spent to see the main plot, as I said I loved it, however I do regret time spent later grinding for titan blood etc. TLDR: as a 10 hour Supergiant game with emphasis on presentation and plot,it is easily 9/10. as a roguelike/lite it is barely a 3-4/10Old Review:One more great game from Supergiant, Hades is a rogue lite masterpiece fit to stand in the hall of fame, next to binding of isaac, enter the gungeon and dead cells. In fact, in some aspects it surpasses them with ease. One thing I particularly love about this game is the explanation of game mechanics through lore and an actually rational explanation on why you have to escape through Hades again and again to progress the plot. Certainly Game of the Year for me (alongside Wasteland 3, though its a completely different genre). Just don\\'t be like me and choose Hell mode. I was like, why not, I unlocked Godhead in Isaac easily, I got this. Well... it\\'s not worth it, the customisability of heat in normal mode is much better for me at least.',\n",

It's story rich and can certainly pull hours of gameplay out of it's assets, but it truthfully has about 10 hours of gameplay, maybe less that's being hidden under what seems like a game that allows choice that is actually hiding the way forward with collectibles. I had hopes for this being a hack n slash with a binding of issac vibe, but I actually feel even more punished playing this than Issac because at least the stuff that ruins a run in Issac is semi random. A regular gameplay is going to be ruined by your inability to get much synergy at all, not having a good way to dodge even with 3 dashes, not having a good way to heal, and armored enemies. Yes I still got to the end of the 3rd area. It's just not fun to play when I know what is going to kill a run and I know collectibles like keys, darkness, and gems that could all have a small chance to drop normally off of mobs, will in fact be taking up chances to get the tools I want. You wouldn't need death defy if the collectibles weren't in the way You wouldn't need extra dashes if you weren't spending extra time running away from every mob in the game because hack n slash is now the same thing as bullet hell.

After nearly fifty hours with Hades I'm almost surprised to find that I truly have no complaints with it, beyond the most pedantic of nitpicks. The art and aesthetics are exquisite. The voice acting is on point. The writing is excellent. The gameplay is responsive and engaging. It runs like a dream. Of course this is game of the year.

For example when using a controller movement is really smooth but the aiming is kind of difficult (nothing significant, just a little inconvenient).

But maybe even more importantly, it actually is fit in with the story, beautifully, and continues to move it along and fill in gaps the more you re-explore.There's so many little details in how to really succeed in this game that you'll start noticing the more you pay attention. The little tones that play that notify you of specific things. The actual clues that are given to you if you talk to the characters enough times. How boons will play off of each other in unexpected ways. The mythology not only stands up and is well researched, but it breathes new life into mythological characters that have been around for thousands of years. Atmospherically, I haven't had this level of experience with even a triple A game in I don't know how long. The first time that Orpheus plays Eurydice's song, I got actual goosebumps.

Never before has a game wanted me to keep playing. Even after finishing the main story quest. I still can\\'t put it out.Though there is little variety through the dungeons. The excitement usually comes from satisfying gameplay, random build mechanics, character interactions and desire to learn more about the main story but of the characters that reside in it.The farther you get in the game, the more becomes available. Never does it feel like things are getting repetitive. You have prophecies to aim for, decorating the Hall of Hades, Heat Gauges, there\\'s so much to do. All the Gods feel perfectly balanced, each one serving a purpose with boons that all feel worth it. Granted, some are stronger than others but no matter who you get, you should always be able to beat the run.When it comes to negatives, the only I could think of is some of the weapons and keepsakes. For weapons, some feel better than the others. This is something I\\'ve seen being as very objective. For me it\\'s the spear and fists that I never enjoy having to manage with. That said, I never had a negative time with them. Actually being blown away when I get Daedalus Hammers to upgrade them.This can\\'t be said about keepsakes. The ones you get from everyone but Olympian Gods are all worth it, They all grant you items that up the possibility of higher rarity boons. Which is pretty on-point for a bunch of Gods who are full of themselves. But either way, it doesn\\'t feel worth equipping them unless it\\'s to get the achievement.Besides that? This game is flawless. If you\\'ve heard the term \"Passion Project\" but never got to experience one.

A bit long i think, especially if i look at the number of combinaisons -Bit unbalanced with the weapons : Some weapons are purely and simply BROKEN and some are completly useless and i mean it, it's a real pain to play with, not challeging, A PAIN. conclusion, a very good game for 20€(25$) and expect to have 40h of gameplay for the main story\",\n",

       " 'I kept hearing about this game and kept shrugging it off as I knew it was a rogue-like which I\\'m not too into but finally gave in to all the talk of it being an example of what a \"perfect\" game would be. At the moment with the playtime of 14 hours, I cannot say a single negative thing about  Hades . The game, as the name would suggest is based in Greek Mythology, following the son of Hades in his quest to escape the underworld. The dialogue is really well done, every God and Greek hero I\\'ve met all have distinct characteristics in how they carry themselves and interact with the player. In my 14 hours I have yet to come across the same line of dialogue for the 2nd time, no matter how many boons i pick up or how many times i return home.For those who are not too familiar with Rogue-likes, the two main gameplay elements are procedurally generated levels and permanent death which means to \"beat\" the game, the player must make it through all 7 realms in a single run. As a rogue-like, the game makes absolute sense as the randomisation of levels is explained by the ever-shifting chambers designed to keep the residents of Hades\\' realm from reaching the surface. You would think as someone who doesn\\'t care about rogue-likes too much, repeatedly starting right at the start of the run would become stale but that really is not the case here.This game really is as good as they say and deserves all of its acclaim.',\n",
